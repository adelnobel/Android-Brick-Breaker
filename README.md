This is the well known brick-breaker game developed for android. I made this game basically for a competition that was held in my college. The game is developed using java for android, you can find the full **Eclipse** project. The source codes are on the following directory  

`/Eclipse Project/CCITCompetition/src/ccit/adel/brickgame`

The full documentation pdfs along with the UML diagrams can be found in `/Documentation`  directory.

The directory `/dx-ball` contains the raw game resources. i.e: imags, psd files, etc
